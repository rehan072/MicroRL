## Introduction

MiniWorld is a minimalistic 3D interior environment simulator for reinforcement
learning &amp; robotics research. It can be used to simulate environments with
rooms, doors, hallways and various objects (eg: office and home environments, mazes).
MiniWorld can be seen as a simpler alternative to VizDoom or DMLab. It is written
100% in Python and designed to be easily modified or extended by students.

Features:
- Few dependencies, less likely to break, easy to install
- Easy to create your own levels, or modify existing ones
- Good performance, high frame rate, support for multiple processes
- Lightweight, small download, low memory requirements
- Provided under a permissive MIT license
- Comes with a variety of free 3D models and textures
- Fully observable [top-down/overhead view](images/maze_top_view.jpg) available
- [Domain randomization](https://blog.openai.com/generalizing-from-simulation/) support, for sim-to-real transfer
- Ability to [display alphanumeric strings](images/textframe.jpg) on walls
- Ability to produce depth maps matching camera images (RGB-D)

Limitations:
- Graphics are basic, nowhere near photorealism
- Physics are very basic, not sufficient for robot arms or manipulation
